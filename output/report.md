      "Use a multimeter to check the signal from the 5th-floor sensor/switch at the elevator controller. A missing or incorrect signal indicates a fault with the sensor, wiring, or controller input.",
      "Access and analyze the elevator controller's error logs. Note any error codes related to door sensors, position indicators, floor selection, or communication errors.",
      "Reboot the elevator controller. If this resolves the issue temporarily, it may indicate a software glitch or intermittent hardware problem.",

      "Always prioritize safety when working on elevators. Disconnect power before working on electrical components and use appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).",
      "Ensure the landing door sensor is calibrated correctly after any adjustments or replacement. Refer to the manufacturer's specifications for calibration procedures.",
      "If the problem is intermittent, carefully document the conditions under which it occurs. This information will be helpful for troubleshooting. Review the maintenance history to see if similar issues have occurred previously.",
      "Ensure that all work performed is documented, including the date, time, actions taken, and results. This will help with future troubleshooting.",
      "Avoid assuming the cause of the problem without thorough investigation. Systematically check each potential cause before moving on."
